# Generics

**Goal**: This module aims to provide a basic understanding of generics in Java.
## Level 1

### Task 1

**Goal** : Create a class with no generic methods to provide understanding of generics in future tasks.

run:
```bash
java src/main/java/levelone/TaskOne.java
```
 ___
### Task 2

**Goal**: Implement a method that takes a generic type as an argument and precesses it.
For this example, we will be passing strings and integers, print their value and class type.

run:
```bash
java src/main/java/levelone/TaskTwo.java
```
___

## Level 2

### Task 1

**Goal**: Add to the task 2 of level a method that takes both a generic attribute and a non-generic one.
For this task I override the print method to take a generic and a String as arguments. Now it will print the value and the message passed as argument.

run:
```bash
java src/main/java/leveltwo/TaskOne.java
```
___
### Task 2

**Goal**: On top of the previous task, create a method that takes a list of generic types.

run:
```bash
java src/main/java/leveltwo/TaskTwo.java
```
